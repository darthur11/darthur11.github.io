– Engineered cross-exchange statistical arbitrage models to exploit cryptocurrency market inefficiencies. These
models utilized real-time bid-ask spread monitoring to identify and profit from transient pricing discrepancies.
– Enhanced trade execution by implementing a price weighting strategy utilizing limit orders as a maker, improving
overall trading performance.
– Played a key role in the collaborative implementation of a comprehensive trading framework, working closely with
developers and analysts to bring the system online.
– Enhanced order routing algorithms to minimize potential slippage and improve execution efficiency.
– Developed a robust and modular Python framework for algorithmic cryptocurrency trading. The framework
implements a workflow with efficient data processing and real-time execution, with inter-module delays
consistently below 5 milliseconds and sub-second decision-making capabilities
– Developed and deployed algo trading strategies using the QuantConnect platform with yearly ROI of 10%.
– Utilized the IB API to automate trading activities and execute trades seamlessly
– Applied Black-Scholes and Heston models in conjunction with event-driven backtesting (eliminating forward
looking bias) to estimate and compare the performance characteristics of quantitative options strategies.
